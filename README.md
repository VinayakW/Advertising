# Dataset - Advertising.csv

# Task Performed -
1. Importing modules and loading the dataset.
2. Checking the Nan values.
3. Performing EDA and Preprocessing.
4. Spliting the data in independent (x) and dependent (y) set.
5. Creating the models.
6. Performing accuracy check.
7. Performing Hyperparameter tuning.
8. Performing accuracy check.
9. Re-creating the model.
10.Performing cross validation.

# Conclusion -

- The max revenue generated by advertising on TV is of approx 296.4 $(lac).
 
- The ovearall average mean sales is 14.022500 unit.
 
- The max sale is of 27.000000 unit.

- As the correlation ranges from -1 to +1 and data have values between this range it can be said that there is a correlation.
  - There is a +ve correlation between "sales" and "TV" , hence it can be said that they are proportional to each other.
  - There is a +ve correlation between "sales" and "newspaper" , hence it  can be said that they are proportional to each other.
  - There is a +ve correlation between "sales" and "radio" , hence it can be said that they are proportional to each other.

- Accuracy of all the models increased after tuning the hyperparameter.

- Max accuracy was achieved by tuning the KNN model.

- The mean accuracy of model was 0.9218484358006359.
